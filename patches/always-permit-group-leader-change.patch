    Always allow to change the group leader
    
    We have free group plans anyway, so it really doesn't make much sense to
    prevent a group leader to hand over leadership to another person.
    
    For the official instance something like this would make sense, because
    the other person didn't necessarily pay or is able to pay for the group
    plan, but on our instance the group plan is free.
