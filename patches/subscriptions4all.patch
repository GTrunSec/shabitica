    Grant lifetime subscriptions to everybody
    
    We do not use payment for our standalone instance, so let's actually
    make sure that everybody is able to play the game without stumbling on
    stuff they can't buy.
    
    Having a lifetime subscription allows players to buy gems for 20 gold in
    the market.
